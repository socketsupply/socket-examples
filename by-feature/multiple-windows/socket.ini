; The value of the "script" property in a build section will be interpreted as a shell command when
; you run "ssc build". This is the most important command in this file. It will
; do all the heavy lifting and should handle 99.9% of your use cases for moving
; files into place or tweaking platform-specific build artifacts. If you don't
; specify it, ssc will just copy everything in your project to the build target.

; the Socket bundle resources directory.
