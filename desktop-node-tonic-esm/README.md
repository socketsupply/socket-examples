# A Tonic example desktop app built with Socket SDK

This app uses [ssc-node](https://github.com/socketsupply/ssc-node) as a backend and [Tonic](https://tonicframework.dev) code bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) for a frontend.

# Build instructions

1. Clone the repo.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:socketsupply/op-examples.git
```
2. Open the React desktop example directory.
```bash
cd tonic-desktop
```
3. Install npm modules.
```bash
npm i
```
or
```bash
yarn
```
4. Install the Socket SDK compiler following with `brew`, `apt-get` or `nuget` (we'll publish it soon).

5. Run the application with `npm start` or `yarn start`
